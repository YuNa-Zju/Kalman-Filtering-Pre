  abstract     = {Kalman Filter ({KF}) that is also known as linear quadratic estimation filter estimates current states of a system through time as recursive using input measurements in mathematical process model. Thus algorithm is implemented in two steps: in the prediction step an estimation of current state of variables in uncertainty conditions is presented. In the next step, after obtaining the measurement, previous estimation is updated by weighted arithmetic mean. Accordingly, using {KF} in non-linear systems can be difficult. For nonlinear systems Extended {KF} ({EKF}) and Unscented {KF} ({UKF}) represent the first-order and higher order linear approximations. {KF} cannot predict appropriate values for modeling system behavior in more complicated systems. In the current study, in addition to referring to basic methods, a review on recent researches on Multiple Model ({MM}) filters has been done. More reliable estimations obtain by using two or more filters with different models in parallel, by allocating an estimation to each filter, outputs of each filter are calculated. {MM} Adaptive Estimation ({MMAE}) and Interacting {MM} ({IMM}) are the most used methods for estimating {MMs}.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, hybrid models of Kalman filter and neural network for state estimation are reviewed of their corresponding academic achievements, the creation of which is a noteworthy development in state estimation. This paper aims to provide a summary of research progress on such hybrid models and emphasize their functions and advantages. First of all, the concept and feature are paid attention to about Kalman filter, and its transmutative modes are taken into consideration. Then several popular neural network algorithms are introduced in brief. Subsequently, research results on hybrid models are analysed and discussed comprehensively. Not only Kalman filter and neural network can be adopted in succession, but also can be mixed in structure. The mixed models can also be divided into two types, the equations or parameters of state–space model are trained by neural network for Kalman filter and the parameters of neural network are updated by Kalman filter. It is proved that the hybrid models outperform than single model of Kalman filter or neural network in accuracy and generalization. Last but not least, the effectiveness of state–space equations of Kalman filter can be established by neural network in nonlinear systems is verified.},

  abstract     = {The state of charge ({SoC}) is the most commonly used performance indicator of battery used in various applications. A chronic erroneous estimation of battery {SoC} may result in constant over charging and discharging, which in turn causes permanent damage to the internal structure of the battery cells along with system disruptions. This paper presents a comprehensive review of different techniques for {SoC} estimation of batteries, followed by a review of Li-ion battery model parameter estimation methods. Then this paper classifies the Kalman filters ({KFs}) in a systematic manner and conducts a detailed literature review on the linear Kalman filter ({LKF}) and non-linear Kalman filters ({NLKFs}). In recent literature, the {NLKFs} such as extended Kalman filter ({EKF}), adaptive {EKF} ({AEKF}), unscented Kalman filter ({UKF}), and adaptive {UKF} ({AUKF}) are the most extensively established techniques for an accurate and reliable {SoC} estimation of batteries. However, the precise estimation of battery {SoC} using the Kalman filters largely relies on accurate battery modeling and its online model parameter estimation. According to the literature, the recursive least square ({RLS}) and the polynomial regression-based battery model ({PRBM}) are the most often used techniques for estimating real-time model parameters of Li-ion batteries. Therefore, this paper performs an experimental comparative performance evaluation of the most popularly used {NLKFS} and battery modeling techniques in terms of {SoC} estimation accuracy at constant and varying operating conditions. The {EKF}, {AEKF}, {UKF}, and {AUKF} techniques augmented with the popularly used {RLS} or {PRBM} are first developed and tested with offline measured data in the {MATLAB} platform. Then they are implemented on the {LabVIEW} based battery testing platform using the Math-Script feature of {MATLAB} for real-time parameters and {SoC} estimation. Rigorous experimental studies have been carried out for comparative performance evaluation of the {PRBM}-{EKF}, {PRBM}-{AEKF}, {PRBM}-{UKF}, {PRBM}-{AUKF}, {RLS}-{EKF}, {RLS}-{AEKF}, {RLS}-{UKF}, and {RLS}-{AUKF} techniques under the standard room temperature (25 ?) and a wide temperature range (-5 ?\& nbsp;to 45 ?). Overall, the {PRBM}-{AUKF} and {RLS}-{AUKF} surpassed other approaches in terms of {SoC} estimation accuracy.},
